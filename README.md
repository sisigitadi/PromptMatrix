*   **Framework Refinement:** Removed the "isNew" tag from "RIDE", "SPICE", and "SOAR" frameworks.
*   **Version Update:** Application version updated to `V6.2.3`.

## ‚ú® What's New in V6.2.2 (Content Update)

This version introduces a new text framework.
*   **Content Update:** Added the "SOAR" framework to the Text Prompt Frameworks.
*   **Version Update:** Application version updated to `V6.2.2`.

## ‚ú® What's New in V6.2.1 (Content Update)

This version focuses on refining the available text frameworks.
*   **Content Update:** Re-added the "RIDE" framework and introduced the new "SPICE" framework to the Text Prompt Frameworks.
*   **Version Update:** Application version updated to `V6.2.1`.

## ‚ú® What's New in V6.2.0 (UI/UX Fixes)

This iteration of V6.2.0 focuses on UI/UX bug fixes and polish based on user feedback.

*   **UI/UX Bug Fixes & Polish:**
    *   **Mobile Subtitle Wrapping:** Fixed an issue where the app subtitle in the header could be truncated on mobile devices by ensuring proper text wrapping logic. The subtitle now correctly wraps to multiple lines if necessary on smaller screens.
    *   **Teaser Popup Reliability:** Addressed a bug where the "Premium Teaser Popup" might not appear reliably as intended on initial load after disclaimer/how-to-use modals. The trigger logic has been refined to ensure the `localStorage` flag (marking it as "shown") is set more accurately when the popup is actually scheduled to display.
    *   **Category & Framework Toggles (Reviewed):** Existing hover effects for category and framework selection buttons were reviewed. Confirmed they already provide unique and informative feedback (icon scaling, button lift, background/text color changes on hover) as per recent requests, so no structural changes were needed for these elements.
*   **Documentation:** Updated `updates.md` and `README.md` to reflect these fixes.
*   **Version:** Maintained at `V6.2.0` as these are primarily bug fixes and minor polish to existing V6.2.0 features.

## ‚ú® What's New in V6.2.0 (Initial Release - Premium Preparation & UI Polish)

This version focuses on clearly articulating the freemium model, preparing the UI for future premium features, and enhancing visual consistency.

*   **Premium Feature Preparation:**
    *   **Visual Distinction:** AI-powered features (Framework Finder & Researcher, Per-Field Suggestions, Overall Feedback, Detailed Analysis, AI Web Research) now use the `AiTextIcon` which changes appearance (color, animation) based on `apiKeyAvailable` (simulating premium status). When `apiKeyAvailable` is false, icons are desaturated, and animations are disabled.
    *   **Clearer User Communication:**
        *   Tooltips for disabled AI features consistently state: "Premium Feature: Subscription Required (Coming Soon)."
        *   Content in `SubscriptionInfoModal` and `TeaserPopupModal` updated to clearly explain the freemium model and the "premium features coming soon" status.
*   **UI/UX Enhancements:**
    *   The `AiTextIcon` is now the standard indicator for AI-powered functionalities, providing consistent visual feedback.
    *   Improved handling of "Other..." option in interactive single-choice dropdowns for a smoother user flow.
    *   General styling refinements for modals and interactive elements.
*   **Content Update:**
    *   Added the "AIDA" framework to the Text Prompt Frameworks.
*   **Code Cleanup:**
    *   Removed the unused `FavTextIcon.tsx` component and its imports.
*   **Version Update:** Application version updated to `V6.2.0`.

## ‚ú® What's New in V6.1.7 (Maintenance & Info Update)

This version focused on refining existing informational content, ensuring version consistency, and maintaining code integrity.

*   **Version Update & Consistency:** Application version updated to `V6.1.7`.
*   **Informational Content Review:** Updated content within Disclaimer, How To Use, and Learn About Premium modals.
