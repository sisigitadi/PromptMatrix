# PromptMatrix - Feature & Update Log

This document provides a history of major features and updates to the PromptMatrix application, helping users understand its evolution and current capabilities.

---
## V6.2.3 (Content Update)
*   **Content Update:**
    *   Added the "STAR" (Situation, Task, Action, Result) framework to the list of Text Prompt Frameworks.
    *   Removed the "isNew" tag from "RIDE", "SPICE", and "SOAR" frameworks.
*   **Version Update:** Application version updated to `V6.2.3` across all relevant files and documentation.

---
## V6.2.1 (Content Update)
*   **Content Update:**
    *   Re-added the "RIDE" (Report, Interpret, Describe, Evaluate) framework to the list of Text Prompt Frameworks.
    *   Added the "SPICE" (Situation, Problem, Implication, Consequence, Example) framework to the list of Text Prompt Frameworks.
*   **Version Update:** Application version updated to `V6.2.1` across all relevant files and documentation.

---
## V6.2.0 (Current Version - UI/UX Fixes)
*   **UI/UX Bug Fixes & Polish:**
    *   **Mobile Subtitle Wrapping:** Fixed an issue where the app subtitle in the header could be truncated on mobile devices by ensuring proper text wrapping logic. The subtitle now correctly wraps to multiple lines if necessary on smaller screens.
    *   **Teaser Popup Reliability:** Addressed a bug where the "Premium Teaser Popup" might not appear reliably as intended on initial load after disclaimer/how-to-use modals. The trigger logic has been refined to ensure the `localStorage` flag (marking it as "shown") is set more accurately when the popup is actually scheduled to display.
    *   **Category & Framework Toggles (Reviewed):** Existing hover effects for category and framework selection buttons were reviewed. Confirmed they already provide unique and informative feedback (icon scaling, button lift, background/text color changes on hover) as per recent requests, so no structural changes were needed for these elements.
*   **Documentation:** Updated `updates.md` and `README.md` to reflect these fixes.
*   **Version:** Maintained at `V6.2.0` as these are primarily bug fixes and minor polish to existing V6.2.0 features.

This icon dynamically changes appearance (color, animation) based on `apiKeyAvailable` (simulating active premium status) or appears desaturated/static if premium features are notionally inactive.
    *   **Clearer User Communication on Premium:**
        *   Tooltips for disabled AI features consistently state: "Premium Feature: Subscription Required (Coming Soon)."
        *   Content in `SubscriptionInfoModal` and `TeaserPopupModal` has been reviewed and updated to clearly explain the freemium model, the value of core free features, and the "premium features coming soon" status for AI-driven enhancements.
*   **UI/UX Enhancements:**
    *   The `AiTextIcon` serves as the standard visual indicator for all AI-powered functionalities, improving UI consistency.

    *   Added the "AIDA" (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) framework to the list of Text Prompt Frameworks.
*   **Code Cleanup:**
    *   Removed the unused `FavTextIcon.tsx` component and its associated imports, streamlining the codebase.
*   **Version Update:** Application version updated to `V6.2.0` across all relevant files and documentation.
